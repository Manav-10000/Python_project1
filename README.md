Title : Advanced Calculator.
Idea  : Just like simple calcultors use commands such as(+,-,*,/,% etc),I thought of a calculator which uses text statements also.

Prerequisits : This project is based on OOPs python Concepts
Description  : This advanced calculator works on the text statement also. The user need not provide algebraic expression always. It fetches the word form the command (given by the                user) and then formulates the expression.
